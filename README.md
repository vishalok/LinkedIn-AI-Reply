# ‘LinkedIn AI Reply’ Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension is built using the **WXT framework** and helps automate message responses on LinkedIn. It allows users to quickly generate predefined responses in the LinkedIn messaging interface, saving time and effort when managing repetitive communication tasks.

## Features

- **Auto-Response Generator:** Provides quick, predefined responses to LinkedIn messages based on user input.
- **Customizable Prompts:** Users can input custom prompts to generate tailored responses.
- **Edit Icon Integration:** Adds an edit icon to LinkedIn's message input field for easy access to the response modal.
- **Tailored Insertion:** Users can insert generated messages directly into LinkedIn’s message input field.

## How It Works

1. **Auto-Response Modal:** 
   - When the user clicks on LinkedIn’s message input area, an edit icon appears.
   - Clicking the edit icon opens a modal where the user can enter a prompt and generate a response.
   
2. **Message Generation:**
   - After entering a prompt, clicking the **Generate** button generates a predefined response (currently hardcoded but can be expanded).
   - The response is shown in the modal for review.
   - The user can insert the generated response directly into the LinkedIn message field by clicking **Insert**.

3. **Regenerate Responses:** 
   - Users can regenerate the response as many times as needed until they are satisfied.

## Technologies Used

- **WXT Framework:** A modern framework for building Chrome extensions.
- **TypeScript:** Strongly typed superset of JavaScript for better development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling the modal.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Standard web technologies for UI and interactions.
